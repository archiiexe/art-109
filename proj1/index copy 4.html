                <h4>2018 Nov 12</h4>
                <p>What happened?</p>
                <p>According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli unit was about 3km (2 miles) inside the Gaza Strip,
                    which borders Israel, when it fired at Nur Barakeh, a commander of the Izzedine al-Qassam brigades,
                    Hamas' military wing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The incident is reported to have happened east of Khan Younis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A gun battle erupted and Israeli tanks and aircraft opened fire in the area, witnesses said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the group, denounced the incident as a "cowardly Israeli attack".
                </p>
                <p>
                    IDF chief Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot said the Israeli unit had carried out "a very meaningful operation to
                    Israel's security", without giving further details.</p>

                    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is planning to effectively annex parts of the
                    occupied West Bank in what would be a major - and highly controversial - act.

                    “We note that, in 2020, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
                    (OCHA) documented 771 incidents of settler violence causing injury to 133 Palestinians and damaging
                    9,646 trees and 184 vehicles mostly in the areas of Hebron, Jerusalem, Nablus and Ramallah,” the
                    experts said. “Already, during the first three months of 2021, more than 210 settler violent
                    incidents were recorded, with one Palestinian fatality. We call upon the Israeli military and police
                    to investigate and prosecute these violent acts with vigor and resolve.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “They primarily target the livelihoods of rural Palestinians, vandalising livestock, agricultural
                    lands, trees and homes,” they said.

                <h4>2022 Feb 01</h4>
                <p>In May 2021, Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem, began
                    protesting against Israel’s plan to forcibly evict them from their homes to make way for Jewish
                    settlers. Many of the families are refugees, who settled in Sheikh Jarrah after being forcibly
                    displaced around the time of Israel’s establishment as a state in 1948. Since Israel occupied East
                    Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah have been
                    continuously targeted by Israeli authorities, who use discriminatory laws to systematically
                    dispossess Palestinians of their land and homes for the benefit of Jewish Israelis.</p>

                <h4>2022 Apr 11</h4>
                <p>Across two governments, each in power for roughly half of 2021, Israeli authorities doubled down on
                    policies to repress Palestinians and privilege Jewish Israelis. The government's policy of
                    maintaining
                    the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian
                    Territory
                    (OPT), coupled with the particularly severe repression against Palestinians living in the OPT,
                    amounts
                    to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.</p>
                <h3>Gaza Strip</h3>
                <p>During the May hostilities, 260 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children, and 2,200 were
                    wounded, "some of whom may suffer a long-term disability requiring rehabilitation," according to
                    OCHA. Authorities in Gaza said that 2,400 housing units were made uninhabitable and over 50,000
                    units were damaged. 8,250 people remained internally displaced as of October 14, OCHA said. The
                    fighting also damaged 331 educational facilities, 10 hospitals, and 23 primary health clinics. The
                    World Bank estimated $380 million in total physical damage and $190 million in economic losses.</p>

                <p>In May 2021, Israel launched a devastating 11-day military offensive on the blockaded Gaza Strip, the
                    fourth major offensive launched by Israel on the Palestinian territory in 14 years.During last
                    year's
                    Israeli offensive in Gaza, Imadeldin Abed's apartment became a refuge for 13 people, gathering to

                    and avoid the bombs falling on the besieged Palestinian territory.At the time he received the call,
                    Abed
                    had been combing through the rubble of a relative's home, which had been bombed, leaving dozens of

                    Council Briefing on Middle East.</p>
              
                <p>The deepening occupation, increase in violence and absence of a political horizon have empowered
                    extremists and are eroding hope, the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Process told the
                    Security Council today as he called on all parties to undertake concrete steps that will change the
                    negative trajectory on the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there were no advancements of housing units in the occupied West Bank during the period of
                    21 September to 7 December, the total number in 2022 remains high, Tor Wennesland noted. Israel must
                    cease the advancement of all settlement activity immediately, end the demolition of
                    Palestinian-owned property, prevent the displacement and eviction of Palestinians and approve plans
                    that will enable them to address their development needs. Detailing the sharp increase in violence
                    against civilians — including children — on both sides, he called on political, religious and
                    community leaders to calm the situation, avoid spreading inflammatory rhetoric and speak up against
                    those seeking to escalate the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there has been progress in Gaza, more must be done to alleviate the humanitarian situation and
                    enable the economy to grow. Solving its challenges will ultimately require political solutions,
                    including a return of the legitimate Palestinian Government to the Strip, a full lifting of Israeli
                    closures and an end to the militant build-up.</p>

                <p>Since his last briefing, a new Government has been sworn into power in Israel, he said. Reiterating
                    the United Nations steadfast support to both sides in achieving a sustainable peace, he outlined
                    recent developments on the ground, noting that a total of 14 Palestinians were killed between 8
                    December 2022 and 13 January 2023, and another 117 were injured by Israeli security forces. Israeli
                    settlers or other civilians perpetrated 63 attacks against Palestinians resulting in 28 injuries,
                    including six children. According to Israeli sources, five Israeli civilians and four security
                    forces personnel were injured by Palestinians in attacks, clashes, the throwing of stones and
                    Molotov cocktails, and other incidents. Palestinians perpetrated a total of 89 attacks against
                    Israeli civilians during the reporting period.</p>
                <p>Giving a detailed report on how violence continued to affect children, he reported that five
                    Palestinian children killed during the reporting period. Among them, a 16-year-old boy was killed
                    near Ramallah as he was apparently preparing to throw stones and paint at Israeli vehicles. On 5
                    January, Israeli security forces shot and killed another 16-year-old during an arrest operation in
                    Balata Refugee Camp in Nablus, and an 18-year-old Palestinian was subsequently shot and killed by an
                    armed Israeli near the settlement outpost of Havat Yehuda on 11 January. Emphasizing that the
                    perpetrators of all acts of violence must be held accountable and swiftly brought to justice, he
                    added that security forces must exercise maximum restraint and use lethal force only when strictly
                    unavoidable in order to protect life. Children must never be the targets of violence or put in
                    harm's way.</p>
                <p>ZHANG JUN (China), calling the situation on the ground "a volcano that may erupt at any time",
                    stressed that only with rock-firm political will and concerted international efforts can the
                    situation be prevented from spinning out of control. Underlining the importance of safeguarding all
                    cultural and religious sites, he said the recent visit by the Israeli Minister to the Aqsa Mosque
                    compound was a major cause for concern. Jordan's custodianship over such sites must be supported and
                    Israel in particular must end all acts of provocation. Noting the recent announcement of a serious
                    of punitive measures to be imposed by Israel, he warned that they will send shockwaves through the
                    entire Palestinian community and its civil society organizations. "Bullying will only [...] diminish
                    the prospects of a political solution," he warned, calling for an end to all unilateral actions that
                    undermine trust and escalate tensions. He also decried all acts of violence by any party, rejected
                    the disproportionate use of force by security troops, called for an end to Israeli
                    settlement-expansion and encouraged the full and urgent implementation a long-overdue two-State
                    solution.</p>

                <h1>Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians by the numbers</h1>
                <h4>2023 Mar 03</h4>
                <p>Between 2010 and 2019, nearly 3,000 Israeli settler attacks killed at least 22 Palestinians and
                    injured 1,258 others across the occupied West Bank.</p>
                <p>Israeli settlements are illegal under international law as they violate the Fourth Geneva Convention,
                    which bans an occupying power from transferring its population to the area it occupies. This is for
                    a variety of reasons, including protecting civilians from the theft of resources by the occupying
                    power and to prevent changes in the demographic makeup of the occupied territory.</p>
                <p>The majority of settlements have been built either entirely or partially on private Palestinian land.
                    Despite being outside of Israel proper, these settlers are granted Israeli citizenship and receive
                    government subsidies that significantly lower their cost of living. In contrast, Palestinians living
                    in the West Bank are subject to Israeli military law.</p>
                <p>On March 1, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's finance minister who also handles civil administration in the
                    occupied West Bank, said Hawara should be "wiped out".</p>

                <p>On May 13, Israeli authorities used force against the funeral procession of Palestinian-American
                    al-Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in Jerusalem, beating mourners, including casket bearers,
                    with batons, firing stun grenades into the crowd, and seizing Palestinian flags. On May 16, Israeli
                    police and Palestinians violently clashed during funeral processions for Walid al-Sharif, a
                    21-year-old Palestinian who died from a brain injury sustained in clashes on April 22 on the Haram
                    al-Sharif/Temple Mount. On May 29, as part of Jerusalem Day celebrations, the "Flags March" took
                    place in Jerusalem in which an estimated 70,000 Israeli marchers entered the Old City of Jerusalem
                    through the Damascus Gate and the Muslim Quarter, according to press reports. Crowds danced and
                    chanted anti-Muslim slogans including insults to the Prophet Muhammad and "death to Arabs." A record
                    number of more than 2,600 Jews toured the Haram alSharif/Temple Mount during the day, while young
                    Palestinians reportedly threw rocks in protest and barricaded themselves inside the al-Aqsa Mosque.
                    The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that Israeli authorities responded using rubber bullets, sound
                    grenades, pepper spray, and, in one instance, live bullets, injuring 79 Palestinians and caused 28
                    to be hospitalized. Police detained more than 60 suspects and remanded 35 for trial.</p>

                <h4>2023 Oct 20</h4>
                <p>The latest escalation of more than 100 years of violence in occupied Palestine has caused phenomenal
                    levels of yet more suffering. This violence must end. The United Nations Office for the Coordination
                    of Humanitarian Affairs reports that at least 3785 people are known to have been killed in besieged
                    Gaza, 79 people killed in the occupied West Bank and 1400 people killed in Israel over the course of
                    12 days, since 7 October 2023.1 As of 19 October, approximately one million Palestinians and people
                    of other nationalities have been internally displaced, many of whom are seeking refuge in
                    overstretched designated emergency shelters and hospitals, several of which have been hit by Israeli
                    airstrikes.1 This represents an increase in the number of internally displaced people in Gaza of
                    more than 2000% in just 12 days.1 30% of all housing units in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or
                    rendered uninhabitable.1 Additionally, Palestinian workers from Gaza who were working in Israel have
                    been beaten, detained and forcibly transferred to overcrowded facilities in the West Bank.</p>

                <h1>STATE OF PALESTINE: Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East
                    Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan</h1>
                <h4>2024 March</h4>
                <p>The drastic acceleration, particularly after 7 October 2023, of long-standing trends of
                    discrimination, oppression and violence against Palestinians that accompany Israeli occupation and
                    settlement expansion have taken the West Bank to the brink of catastrophe.</p>
                <p>The establishment and continuing expansion of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and
                    the occupied Syrian Golan amount to the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into the
                    territories that it occupies, which is strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law.
                    Such transfers amount to a war crime that may engage the individual criminal responsibility of those
                    involved.</p>
                <p>The ongoing expansion of Israeli settlements involves numerous human rights violations against
                    Palestinians, including their rights to self-determination, equality and non-discrimination.</p>
                <p>These violations, which have become more serious over the reporting period, create a coercive
                    environment that displaces Palestinians from their homes and their lands and that could amount to
                    forcible transfer.</p>
                <p>The transfer of wide administrative powers relating to settlements and land administration from the
                    military authorities to Israeli civilian officials, who are elected and accountable to the
                    population of Israel, could facilitate the annexation of the West Bank.</p>
                <p>The international community has failed, both individually and collectively, to take adequate,
                    feasible and effective measures to ensure the compliance of Israel with its international
                    obligations.</p>
                <p>To address the current crisis and the wider context of occupation, it is critical for States Members
                    of the United Nations, including the primary duty bearer, Israel, to find a viable political
                    solution that finally addresses the underlying human rights violations of the Palestinian people.
